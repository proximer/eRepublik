**changes made**

TO FIX:

print command is not taking 0 arguments. change nargs="?"

TO ADD:

search function to sort results in alphabetical order of player name

Add an <update> command to update your stocks
It kind of actually defeats the whole purpose of the trades, but yeah xD

Make more logs of important things, not just trades

Stop the program from always "breaking"... Google that nice library "atexit"
