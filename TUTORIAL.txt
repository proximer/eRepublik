Hey, for you to better understand I figured that I should simulate a session with the iTrader.

Just open it up. If it is the first time, ignore the "Could not load data" and type your nick.

now off to the interactive session. First, I advise you to read the README.txt that comes with the package.

Now for the commands:
(Lines starting with $ are things you should type. EVERYTHING except for the $)

Start of by asking your database to register my id:

$register 6328829 Rojer97 -n Rojer97 -i good guy, created this program

That stored my ID in the database, along with my IRC nick (-n flag) and some chaty chat with the -i flag.

now if you type

$check 6328829

And the program will tell you that that ID is registered

Now you are going to buy 340 weapons Q7 from me, at 9.7 a piece...
But how much is that??

$calc 340*9.7

And the program prints 3298. Sometimes, the program could say something like 3297.9999999999995
That is because computers have always had problems with decimals... In a future update I'll fix the print to prevent this.

So, if the cost for 340 is 3298, and you were to buy me that, you could register the trade:

$trade buy 6328829 wq7 340 3298

and you would get some nice information printed.
after this, your log file is not empty anymore, so you can use the <log> command to check your trades!
You only have one, but lets check "all of them"

$log all

(to be continued)
